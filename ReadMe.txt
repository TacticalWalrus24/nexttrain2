To set up first load up mysql on local host and import sql file to create database, you can start the programme by clicking on the GUI.py file
the buttons on the right side of the application create stations, junctions and allow you to connect widgets with rails.
the station button creates a station on the screen that can then be dragged and dropped where the user would like.
the junction button creates a junction that is used to connect multiple rails together
the rail button once clicked will remain depressed until clicked again, while depressed you can click from widget to widget and they will become connected
if you right click it will break off the chain and allow for an independant rail to be made
if you double click on stations or junctions a window will pop up displaying info about the node and attached rails and allow you to alter variables
the schedule button switches the sideboard from build mode to a route panel, clicking on the create route button allows you to create routes in much
the same way as you could create rails, it is not nessesary to highlight every node the route passes only the ones the train should stop at
when you're done with a route right click to start a new one or click submit route to finish, the side board will need to be reloaded to show the new routes
(I can fix this i just ran out of time)
if you double click one of the routes details about the route will be shown and you can use the entry field to create a schedule
